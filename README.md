Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy was last updated on October 12, 2020

This Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) explains how the Explorer App (“Onetek.com”, “OneTek”, “we” or “us”) collect, use and share personally identifiable information of visitors of our app (the "App"). Please note that the primary purpose of our App is to allow you to view the content of our App. For the purpose of this Privacy Policy, information that you provide through the App can be in one of two categories: information relating to your use of the App is referred to as “App Information” while information relating to further collaboration (e.g. that OneTek will build an App for you) is referred to as “Product Information”. When this Privacy Policy uses the generic term “information” it is intended to address the general use of information, and not your specific App Information or Product Information. By using the App, you consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your personally identifiable App Information and Product Information, as applicable, in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

1. Personally Identifiable Information We Collect and How We Use It.
You can generally visit the App without revealing any personally identifiable information about yourself. We do not collect personal information from our App visitors without the App visitor providing us with this information as set forth in this Privacy Policy.

If you request to receive company or product information, or request information about specific Services, or provide comments about Services, you will be asked to provide contact information so that we can complete your request. We use this App Information to fulfill your request. We may also use this App Information to send you additional information about our Services or Products.

2. Other Information We Collect and How We Use It.
The Explorer App does not collect any other information than what is stated in this Privacy Policy. 

3. Children.
We recognize the privacy interests of children and we encourage parents and guardians to take an active role in their children’s online activities and interests. This App has no age restriction, thus any personally identifiable information is handeled as the bullet above, "Personally Identifiable Information We Collect and How We Use It". However, OneTek will not enter any agreement of our purchasable services (not presented in the App) with any child below 18 without a guardians consent. 

4. Disclosure of Information.
We will share your personally identifiable Site Information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy policy. These include, but are not limited to, sharing Site Information with service providers to allow them to fulfill your requests. We do not sell your personal information to third parties. Please refer to the sections above on personally identifiable and other Product Information for how Product Information may be used.

We may also disclose your personally identifiable information: (a) if we are required to do so by law, regulation or other government authority or otherwise in cooperation with an investigation of a governmental authority, (b) to enforce these Terms of Use, or (c) to protect the safety of Users of our App and our Services and Products. In addition, we may transfer your personally identifiable information to a successor entity upon a merger, consolidation or other corporate reorganization.

5. Data Retention.
We retain App Information on behalf of Users for as long as needed to provide the Services. We will retain and use this personal App Information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements with Users, and/or the period required by laws in applicable jurisdictions. Please see the sections above for how Product Information may be used.

6. Updating, Correcting and Deleting Your Information; Opt-out.
If you believe that OneTek has incorrect App Information or Product Information that was provided as part of the Services, you may contact us by e-mailing our customer support at info@onetek.se.

From time to time, we may send you emails about Products or new or modified Services that we believe might interest you. If you wish to opt-out of receiving these materials, you may follow the unsubscribe procedure provided in the email.

7. Security.
The security of your personal information is important to us. OneTek employs procedural and technological measures to protect your personally identifiable information. These measures are reasonably designed to help protect your personally identifiable information from loss, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction. We may use software, secure socket layer technology (SSL) encryption, password protection, firewalls, internal restrictions and other security measures to help prevent unauthorized access to your personally identifiable information. However, OneTek cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat these measures or use your personally identifiable information for improper purposes. Therefore, you should be aware that when you voluntarily display or distribute personally identifiable information, that information could be collected and used by others. OneTek is not responsible for the unauthorized use by third parties of information you post or otherwise make available publicly.

8. Links to Other Websites.
The App may provide links to third party web sites or resources not associated with us and over which we do not have control (“External Web Sites”). Such links do not constitute an endorsement by OneTek of the External Web Sites, the content displayed therein, or the persons or entities associated therewith. You acknowledge that OneTek is only providing these links as a convenience, and cannot be responsible for the content of such External Web Sites.

9. Material Changes.
OneTek reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post the revised Privacy Policy on this Site located at https://github.com/johandanmo/Privacy-Policy/edit/main/README.md and will either send a notice to the e-mail address that you specified in your registration and/or post notice of the change so it is visible when users log-on for the first time prior to said changes taking effect so that you are always aware of what personal information we may collect and how we may use this information. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes. Your continued use of the Site and/or Services will be subject to the then-current Privacy Policy.

10. Contact Us.
We welcome your comments or questions concerning our Privacy Policy. If you would like to contact OneTek regarding this Privacy Policy, please contact us by emailing us at info@onetek.com.
